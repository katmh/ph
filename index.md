## Why is this important?

Heart disease causes 1 in 4 deaths in the US (source), and transplants are the only treatment for patients with severe heart failure. Since the supply of cardiac donors is limited, we must explore approaches to regenerating _infarcted_ hearts—those that have undergone tissue death due to inadequate blood supply.

So far, bioengineers have created simple tissues that lack blood vessels. They often use degradable scaffolds that help cells reorganize into tissues. To avoid implant rejection, the scaffold materials must share similar biochemical and mechanical properties as actual heart tissues. Ideally, the materials come from the patient being treated. To date, these have been challenges.

## What's the new accomplishment?

For the first time, researchers used patient tissues to develop "bioinks" for 3D printing. They printed a cardiac patch with a blood vessel system capable of keeping cells alive, as well as a rabbit-sized heart using a new technique to support large, complex constructions. 

## How did they do it?

The researchers took a biopsy of fatty tissue from patients and separated the cells from the extracellular matrix (ECM). They reprogrammed the cells back to their unspecialized states, then differentiated them into 

The patch dimensions and blood vessel geometry were designed using computer-aided design (CAD) software that used data from computerized tomography (CT) images. Since CT cannot capture small blood vessels, which are to spread oxygen through the whole patch, they were mathematically modeled.


## What are the results?

The researchers used several methods to confirm that they reached the goals set during their engineering design process.

## What does this mean for the future?

Long-term *in vitro* and *in vivo* studies
