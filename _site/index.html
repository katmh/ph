<h2 id="why-is-this-important">Why is this important?</h2>

<p>Heart disease causes 1 in 4 deaths in the US (source), and transplants are the only treatment for patients with severe heart failure. Since the supply of cardiac donors is limited, we must explore approaches to regenerating infarcted hearts—those that have undergone tissue death due to inadequate blood supply.</p>

<p>So far, bioengineers have created simple tissues that lack blood vessels. They often use degradable scaffolds that help cells reorganize into tissues. To avoid implant rejection, the scaffold materials must share similar biochemical and mechanical properties as actual heart tissues. Ideally, the materials come from the patient being treated. So far, these have been challenges.</p>

<h2 id="whats-the-new-accomplishment">What’s the new accomplishment?</h2>

<p>For the first time, researchers used patient tissues to develop “bioinks” for 3D printing. They printed a cardiac patch with a blood vessel system capable of keeping cells alive, as well as a rabbit-sized heart using a new technique to support large, complex constructions.</p>

<p>The researchers took a biopsy of fatty tissue from patients, then separated the cells from the extracellular matrix (ECM). The cells were reprogrammed into stem cells, then differentiated into</p>

<p>The patch dimensions and blood vessel geometry were designed using computer-aided design (CAD) software that used data from computerized tomography (CT) images. Since CT cannot provide images of small blood vessels, and small vessels are needed to ensure adequate exposure of the entire cardiac patch to the</p>
