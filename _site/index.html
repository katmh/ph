<h2>Why is this important?</h2>

<p>Heart disease causes 1 in 4 deaths in the US, and transplants are the only treatment for patients with severe heart failure (“Heart Disease Fact Sheet”, 2019). Since the supply of cardiac donors is limited, we must explore approaches to regenerating infarcted hearts—those that have undergone tissue death due to inadequate blood supply.</p>

</div>

<p>So far, bioengineers have created simple tissues that lack blood vessels. They often use degradable scaffolds that help cells reorganize into tissues. To avoid implant rejection, the scaffold materials must share similar biochemical and mechanical properties as actual heart tissues. Ideally, the materials come from the patient being treated. To date, these have been challenges (Vunjak-Novakovic et al., 2009).</p>

<h2>What's the new accomplishment?</h2>

<p>For the first time, researchers used patient tissues to develop "bioinks" for 3D printing. They printed a cardiac patch with a blood vessel system capable of keeping cells alive, as well as a small human heart using a new technique to support large, complex constructions (Noor et al., 2019).</p>

<h2>How did they do it?</h2>

<p>The researchers took a biopsy of fatty tissue from patients and separated the cells from the extracellular matrix (ECM). They reprogrammed the cells into unspecialized stem cells, then turned them into cardiomyocytes (CMs) and endothelial cells (ECs) in a process called differentiation. CMs are heart muscle cells, and ECs line the interior surface of blood vessels.</p>

<p>The dimensions of a cardiac patch and its blood vessel system were designed using computer-aided design (CAD) software and data from computerized tomography (CT) images. Since CT cannot capture small blood vessels, which are crucial to spreading oxygen through the whole patch, they were mathematically modeled.</p>

</div>

<p>The ECM was processed into a hydrogel, then mixed with the functional cells. A 3D printer used this mixture, which served as a bioink, to print thick (~2mm), 3D, patient-specific cardiac patches containing blood vessels.</p>

<p>Since the hydrogel can't sustain its weight, the researchers developed a different strategy for printing whole organs or more complex tissues. Building on previous studies, they designed a support medium that was transparent, cell-friendly, and could withstand a wide range of temperatures, and used it to fabricate a small-scale human heart.</p>

<h2>What are the results?</h2>

<p>The researchers used several methods to confirm that they reached the goals set during their engineering design process. To test the patch's function, they contracted the engineered tissue and measured calcium signals, which generally exceeded 10cm/s.</p>

<p>To assess the presence and structure of the patches <i>in vivo</i>, the researchers fluorescently stained and transplanted them between two layers of rat tissue. After extracting and staining them, the cells were properly assembled, with striation, indicating a potential for contractility.</p>

</div>

<p>For the printed heart, blue and red dyes were injected into the right and left ventricles, respectively, to demonstrate the integrity of the different compartments and ability for blood to circulate through the vessels.</p>

<h2>What does this mean for the future?</h2>

<p>The results are exciting and promising, but long-term <i>in vitro</i> (outside a living organism) and <i>in vivo</i> studies are necessary to see if they're feasible for therapeutic purposes. These engineered hearts can also be used as realistic organs to test potential medicines.</p>

<p>Patches, hearts, and scaffolding materials derived from a patient's own tissue will not provoke a immune response, eliminating the need for immunosuppression treatment (Edri et al., 2019).</p>

<p>Additionally, improvements can be made in many steps of the process. To obtain the high number of cells needed for bioinks, stem cell expansion techniques must become more efficient. New approaches are needed for long-term cultivation of organs, including supplying biochemical and physical cues to aid their maturation. Furthermore, strategies to image entire blood vessels of the heart and to precisely print small-diameter blood vessels within thick structures should be developed (Noor et al., 2019).
